Numbers in Python 3
Number data types store numeric values. They are immutable data types.
Immutable means changing the value of a number data types results in a newly allocated object.
Number objects are created when you assign a value to them. e.g var1 = 12
The following is a syntax on how you can delete the reference to a number object by using del statement.
del var1[, var2[,var3[...,varN]]]]
You can also delete a single object or multiple objects by using the del statement. Example;
del var
del var_a, var_b

Python supports the following numerical types;
- int (signed integers): positive or negative whole numbers with no decimal point. Python 2 has 2 integer types - int and long(not present in python 3)
- float (floating point real values)/floats: represent real numbers and are written with a decimal point dividing the integer and the fractional parts.
Floats may also be in scientific notation, with E or e indicating the power of 10 (2.5e2 = 2.5 x 10^2 = 250).
- complex (complex numbers): are of the form a + bJ, where a and b are floats and J (or j) represents the square root of -1 (which is an imaginary number).
The real part of the number is a, and the imaginary part is b. Complex numbers are not used much in python programming.

Run the following codes on python console to get the results;
>>> number = 0xA0F #Hexa-decimal
>>> number
2575
>>> number=0o37 #Octal
>>> number
31

Number Type Conversion
int(x) - converts x to a plain integer
long(x) - converts x to a long integer
float(x) - converts x to a floating-point number
complex(x) - convert x to a complex number with real part x and imaginary part zero
complex(x, y) - converts x and y to a complex number with real part x and imaginary part y. x and y are numeric expressions.

Mathematical Functions

abs(x) - The absolute value of x: the (positive) distance between x and zero.
ceil(x) - The ceiling of x: the smallest integer not less than x
cmp(x, y) - -1 if x < y, 0 if x == y, or 1 if x > y. Deprecated in Python 3; Instead use return (x>y)-(x<y).
exp(x) - The exponential of x: e^x
fabs(x) - The absolute value of x
floor(x) - The largest integer not greater than x
log(x) - The natural logarithm of x, for x>0
log10(x) - The base-10 logarithm of x for x>0
max(x1, x2,...) - The largest of its arguments: the value closest to positive infinity.
min(x1, x2,...) - The smallest of its arguments: the value closest to negative infinity.
modf(x) - The fractional and integer parts of x in a two-item tuple.Both parts have same sign as x. The imteger part is returned as float.
pow(x, y) - The value of x**y.
round(x[.n]) - x rounded to n digits from the decimal point. Python rounds away from zero as a tie-breaker: round(0.5) is 1.0 and round(-0.5) is -1.0
x - Is a numeric expression
n - Represents number of digits from decimal point up to whoch x is to be rounded.
sqrt(x) - The square root of x for x > 0.

Random Number Functions
choice(seq) - A random item from a list, tuple or string.
randrange ([start,] stop [,step]) - A randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)
start - Start point of the range.
stop - stop point of the range.
step - value with which number is incremented. Default is 1.
random() - A random float r, such that 0 is less than or equal to r and r is less than 1.
seed([x]) - Sets the integer starting value used in generating random numbers. Call this function before calling any other random module function. Return None.
For instance,
seed ([x], [y])
x - Is the seed for the next random number. If omitted, then it takes system time to generate the next random number.
If x is an int, it is used directly.
y - Is the version number (default is 2). str, byte or byte array object gets converted in int. Version 1 used hash() of x.

shuffle(lst) - Randomizes the items of a list in place. Returns none.
For instance,
shuffle (lst, [random])
lst - This could be a list or tuple
random - Is an optional 0 argument function returning float between 0.0 - 1.0. Default in None.
uniform(x, y) - A random float r, such that x  is less than or equal to r and r is less than y.
For instance,
uniform(x, y)
x - Sets the lower limit of the random float.
y - Sets the upper limit of the random float.

Trigonometric Functions
degrees(X) - Converts angle x from radians to degrees.
tan(X) - Return the tanget of x radians.
atan2(Y, X) - Return atan(Y / X), in radians.
sin(X) - Return the sine of x radians.
asin(X) - Return the arc sine of X, in radians.
cos(X) - Return the cosine of x radians.
acos(X) - Return the arc cosine of X, in radians.
radians(X) - Converts angle x from degrees to radians.
hypot(X, Y) - Return the Euclidean norm, sqrt(X*X + Y*Y).
